#+TITLE: Eder's 1984 paper "Properties of Substitutions and Unifications" in Coq

This is my attempt to learn to do stuff in Coq and I thought it would
be a good idea to follow an actual paper, trying to prove everything
in it.

To build, run =bootstrap.sh= in the repository, then =make=. Running
=make all.pdf= will generate a LaTeX proof document. Some of the
sections have some nice descriptions, in particular the stuff about
finite sets. You'll need the Tikz commutative diagram package to
render the LaTeX.
